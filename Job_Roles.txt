Below are the job roles for the week. Please add what you plan to work on so nothing gets duplicated.

Everyone: Flowcharts for the code you have made so far and for the code you are currently working on

Suraj: Improve the chatbot's repsonses to user input that it doesn't understand such as random answers to questions or statements
       that make no sense etc.

Delia: Work on the casual conversation questions and casual conversation in-general
       Make holding a conversation between the chatbot and the user easier

Andre: Add a score system for when the user asks for multiple trivia questions so they can see how they did
       Recommend places to check for answers to a question if the chatbot doesn't know the answer (Possibly work with Suraj on
       this one)
